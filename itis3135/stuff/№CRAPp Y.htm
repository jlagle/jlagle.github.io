He only accepts requests written in ancient Sumerian on ethically sourced parchment. Last time someone tried using printer paper, he summoned a swarm of bureaucratic pigeons to deliver a cease-and-desist. After the parchment incident, he started wearing a powdered wig made of live ferrets to court, claiming it gave him "legal enlightenment." When opposing counsel objected, he simply whispered, "Lex ferreta," and the judge, too bewildered to argue, let it slide. Rumor has it he once won a case by presenting his argument entirely in limericks, leaving the jury both impressed and deeply concerned. One time, a client tried to pay him in normal U.S. dollars, and he scoffed, insisting he only accepted payment in rare pogs from the 1990s or cursed pirate doubloons. When a rival attorney tried to serve him legal papers, he counter-served them with a subpoena written in invisible ink, which could only be read under the light of a full moon. His most famous case involved defending a mime who had allegedly stolen an entire invisible car—he won by cross-examining an imaginary witness so convincingly that the judge started taking notes.</p>
