            <h3>Bad Example: <a href="https://arngren.net/">Arngren</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Apple's</strong> website has a modern and sleek deign. There is a lot of gaps in the website, making it easier for viewers to look at and read. It boasts a grid-shapped layout which enhances its products.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>There is no good contrast present. Everything blends together and colors feel random.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>There is a complete lack of repetition in any shape or pattern in this website. Each ad is completely different than the other.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>There is hardly any alignment present in this website. There are so many different lines that split everything up making it super hard to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>There is barely any spacing present in this website. Every block is pressed super close up to the next increasing the difficulty to read it once again.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Good Example: <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a></h3>
            <p><strong>Arngren's</strong> website is comompletely incomprehensible. There is no structure or repetition and there is no space anywhere. It is impossible to read or view anythign on this website. It is just an all-around ugly website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast: </strong>Apple has a very light contrast which is easy on readers eyes, making their website comfortable to read.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition: </strong>The geometry on the website is consistent in shape and spacing. This lets the viewers predict what will be next.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment: </strong>There is even alignment along every item. Apple has few rows and columns with only a couple main areas of attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity: </strong>Items of similar interest are grouped together naturally  and with enough space for an easy reading experience.</li>
            </ul>
