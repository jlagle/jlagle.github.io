        <h3>General Requirements</h3>
        <ul class="review-list">
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> I like the layout of the page, it isn't cluttered and is easy to read. The contrast between the blue and pink might be too harsh however. I really like the overlapping elements you have to make the left side of your bubbles stand out from other websites. Something else you might want to add is some sort of division in the head element around the blue box since it's inside the pink (something like a border, dropshadow, etc). Another mention that is more of a personal preference, but I think a font other than Arial would work better for a website with a kids theme to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Page Elements:</strong> Main, header, footer, and nav bar are present.</li>
            <li><strong>Header Element:</strong> All requirements are present. The stars to seperate the links fit well with the page theme.</li>
            <li><strong>Main Element:</strong> All main requirements are present. The section elements are well-used and make sense. In the "Who we Serve" section, it wasn't obvious that you could/should click on it, but whatever is supposed to happen also doesn't work (I assume you know this but just making sure).</li>
            <li><strong>Tagline:</strong> Tagline isn't present but also isn't required for this assignment.</li>
            <li><strong>Footer Element:</strong> Validators are present but CSS is not fully validated (also, both W3C validator and Accumulus are not needed simultaneously). Link to company page doesn't work correctly (my guess is you copied the normal path which just needs to be changed since the client project is in a different folder than normal).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
        <ul class="review-list">
            <li><strong>Structure:</strong> All 5 pages are present, files are seperated, and the basics of your HTML and CSS look good. Certian functionality like the first section expanding needs to be fixed however.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Page:</strong> Homepage requirements are met and overall has a very nice design.</li>
            <li><strong>Nav Bar:</strong> The nav abr is consistent and working across all of your pages.</li>
            <li><strong>Other Pages:</strong> The 4 other pages all meet their requirements of having the nav bar, content, and good names. The only suggestion/comment I have is that your file names probably don't need to be the exact name of your pages, they could definitely be shortened (community_and_events.html -> community.html, etc). While not required, it's just something I noticed.</li>
