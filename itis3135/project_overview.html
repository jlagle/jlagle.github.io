        <h2>Dynamic Functionality:</h2>
        <p>We plan to have an interactive photo/video gallery for the past showcases. There is also plans to use JS to make the site fun and visually appealing with animations using JS. I will also try to let it server as a way to submit a member application to Move.</p>
        <p>Example of photo gallery: https://www.pexels.com/</p>
        <p>This example shows information or other options displayed when hovering a photo. It also might be in a wheel fashion where the user clicks a button to go to the next image or something similar.</p>
