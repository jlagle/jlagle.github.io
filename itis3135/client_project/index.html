        <h2>About the Organization</h2>
        <p class="indent">MOVE Dance Alliance is a student organization dedicated to providing a creative outlet through various styles of dance.
            Join us to explore choreography, performances, and lifelong friendships.</p>
        <p class="indent">MOVE is an organization that gives Charlotte students a chance to choreograph and perform every semester in a professional dance showcase.
            We are open to dancers of all different dance backgrounds and allow our members to have full artistic freedom in creating and performing their own dance works.
            Members are free to create their own piece, or perform in other choreographer's pieces. In addition to our showcase, we also hold various events and rehersals that help
            members establish their skills and make meaningful relationships with one another to help strengthen the Charlotte dance community. </p>
