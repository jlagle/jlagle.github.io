            As seen in the screenshot above, I was unable to access any pages other than the homepage. I didn't want to turn up empty-handed so I just reviewed the home site intead.</p>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <ul class="review-list">
            <li><strong>Design:</strong> Page has a good color scheme that is easy for the user to read and is visually appealing. CRAP looks to be good as well.</li><hr>
            <li><strong>Page Elements:</strong> Main, header, and footer are present. <strong>Nav bar missing.</strong></li><hr>
            <li><strong>Header Element:</strong> All requirements are present</li><hr>
            <li><strong>Main Element:</strong> Does <strong>not</strong> start with the name of page or include name of page. The text provided should realistically be a paragraph element rather than an h2 as well.</li><hr>
            <li><strong>Tagline:</strong> Tagline is present in header. I like the tag you chose, it sounds very unique and mysterious. I'd recommend putting it in lowercase rather than each word being capitalized.</li><hr>
            <li><strong>Footer Element:</strong> Footer does <strong>not</strong> include any links. The W3C validator doesn't correctly display the new page, instead reloads current page? And the accumulus validator is present but does not validate HTML or JS, and has warnings for CSS.</li><hr>
            <li><strong>Other Notes:</strong> There were <strong>no</strong> links to other pages for me to view. I tried manually using urls like "iitis3135/contract.html" which were not present. This means they either don't exist or are named incorrectly.</li>
        </ul>
